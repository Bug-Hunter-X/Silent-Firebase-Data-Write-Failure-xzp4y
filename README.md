# Silent Firebase Data Write Failure

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Firebase application where data fails to write to the Realtime Database without throwing any errors. The application appears to function correctly, executing the `.then()` block, but the data is not persisted.  The root cause and solution are provided below.

## Bug Description
The code attempts to write user data to Firebase. While the `then` promise executes without error, the data does not reach the database.  Standard error handling catches nothing. This makes debugging exceptionally challenging.

## Solution
The issue arises from insufficient security rules.  The database rules must explicitly permit writes to the specified path.   The solution involves correctly configuring Firebase security rules to allow data writes.

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2.  Set up a Firebase project and obtain necessary credentials.
3. Configure Firebase in your project using the provided code snippets.
4. Attempt to run the application with the initially provided `bug.js` file.  Note that no data is written.
5. Replace `bug.js` with `bugSolution.js`, configure Firebase security rules, and re-run.  Data should now successfully write to the database.
