The following code snippet demonstrates a Firebase error where data is not being written to the database even though there are no apparent errors in the code.  This is particularly problematic because there's no clear error message in the console logs. The expected behavior is for the `setData()` method to write the data to the Firebase Realtime Database, but it does not.

```javascript
//Attempting to write data to Firebase
firebase.database().ref('users/' + userId).set({
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john.doe@example.com'
}).then(() => {
  console.log('Data written successfully!');
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error('Error writing data:', error);
});
```
