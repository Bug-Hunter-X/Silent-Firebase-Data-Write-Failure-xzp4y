The solution involves correctly configuring Firebase Realtime Database security rules. Without properly configured rules, the write operation might be silently blocked.  Below is an example of database rules that allow writes to the 'users' node.  These rules should be added to your Firebase project's security rules.  Remember to replace `$uid` with the user's UID if you intend to only allow writes by authenticated users.

```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    ".write": "auth != null",
    "users": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "$uid == auth.uid",
        ".write": "$uid == auth.uid"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
The JavaScript code remains the same as in the bug report; the problem is now resolved by the addition of appropriate security rules. If writing without authentication is desired (generally not recommended for production applications), replace  `"auth != null"` with `true` in the above configuration.  Always prioritize secure database rules to prevent unauthorized access and data modifications.
